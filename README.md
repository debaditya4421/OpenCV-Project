# CV-Project
Making a project using python based computer vision library OpenCV based on what we have learnt in the Winter Workshop

TASK 1.1 :
 
1. The randmatrix.py file contains the program to generate a random matrix in case we only want to generate a random matrix.
2. We have upsized our random matrix from 40*40 to 400*400 .
3. Implemented BFS, DFS , Djikstra and Astar algorithm.
4. We have also used another path finding algorithm - RRT algorithm - Rapidly Exploring Random Tree. 

TASK 1.2 : 
1. The image being used in this program is named “map1.2.png”. The image needs to be downloaded before running the program. All the 5 algorithms are successfully implemented on this image.

TASK 1.3 :
1. The image being used in this program is named “homemap.jpeg”. The image needs to be downloaded before running the program. 
2. All the 5 algorithms that we have used, have been implemented successfully. 

TASK 2.1:
1. We have used 15 different images showing different traffic signals.
2. A video of about 1.5 minutes is generated using the 15 different images at random ensuring that a red traffic light is always followed by a green traffic light.

TASK 2.2:
1. The video generated in part 2.1 is read and depending on the different road signals, the program will generate different outputs and store them in a text file, ‘directionOutputs2.txt’ .


Bonus Part - TASK 2.3:

TASK 2.3a :
1. Using the 15 different images at random, a video  of about 1.5 minutes is generated and simultaneously based on different road signals, different outputs are stored in a text file, ‘directionOutputsBonus.txt’ .
2. For the bonus part, we have stored the image number as the output in the text file.
