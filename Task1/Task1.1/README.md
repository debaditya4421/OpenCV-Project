# TASK 1.1 :
 
1. The randmatrix.py file contains the program to generate a random matrix in case we only want to generate a random matrix.
2. We have upsized our random matrix from 20*20 to 60*60, 40*40 and 100*100 because most are facing stack overflow with higher order matrices.
3. For the Dijkstra and Astar program, we have considered the weights for horizontal/vertical moves as 2 and for diagonals 1. 
4. The Dijkstra program takes about 10 to 15 seconds to compile.
5. We have also used another path finding algorithm - RRT algorithm - Rapidly Exploring Random Tree.
